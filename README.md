# PDFClown
This project aims to enhance PDF Clown library. PDF Clown provides a universal access to PDF files (creation, reading, editing, rendering...) through an accurate and elegant object-oriented API.
However, there are few limitations of PdfClown. This repo intends to remove those limitations and enhance the original library.

Enhancement 1:

To begin with, this repo enhances the "RenderingSample" java class of PdfClown. The original class returns a blank image while rendering a pdf file page containing png image.Now, with enhancement this class renders pdf file with a page containing png images.
